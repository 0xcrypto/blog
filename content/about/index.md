## Hi, I am Vikrant (But if you are here, very likely you already know this).
Nothing big, I just poke around, hack and sometimes write about it. Academic qualifications are not worth mentioning. In the name of professional career, I spent my 6 years learning and 4 years making software and websites for food. Now I have left the day labor, hunting bug bounties these days and will probably move to a cave or something to live my life in peace.
